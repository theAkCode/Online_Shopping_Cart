# ShoppingCartDemo  

This is a Java project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It simulates a shopping cart system where users can add products, calculate prices, apply discount coupons, and place orders.  

## Concepts Used  
- **Encapsulation**: Classes like `Cart`, `Product`, and `Order` manage their own data.  
- **Inheritance**: Different product types (`Electronics`, `Clothing`) inherit from a common `Product` class.  
- **Polymorphism**: `calculatePrice()` is overridden in different product classes.  
- **Exception Handling**: Handles invalid product additions, removals, and coupon codes.  

## How to Run  
Compile and run the `ShoppingCartDemo.java` file.
